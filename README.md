#  Air Crashes Analysis (1908-2023)

##  Overview

This project analyzes global air crashes from **1908-2023** using **Python**. The dataset is cleaned and visualized to uncover trends, most affected airlines, and geographical patterns.

##  Dataset

- **Source**: [Kaggle Air Crashes Full Data (1908-2023)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jogwums/air-crashes-full-data-1908-2023)
- **Total Records**: 5,000+ air crashes

   ├── visualization.py (generates plots)

```
##  Data Cleaning Steps

- Removed **duplicates & missing values**
- Converted **dates & locations** to correct formats
- **Fetched and added precise Latitude & Longitude** for mapping using **OpenStreetMap API (Nominatim)** to enrich the dataset
- Saved cleaned dataset: `data/processed/cleaned_aircrashes.csv`

##  Visualizations & Insights
### You can see the reports in the reports/figures 

| Chart                        | Insight                                                         |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  Crashes Over Time         | Air crashes peaked between 1960-1990 and declined after 2000    |
|  Geographical Distribution | USA & Russia had the most crashes                               |
|  Top Aircraft Models       | Boeing & Airbus have the highest crash records                  |
|  Correlation Heatmap       | Fatalities strongly correlate with number of passengers onboard |
|  Severity & Impact         | Major crashes are often linked to larger aircraft               |
